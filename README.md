# Model Explainability Investigation & Analysis
Master thesis project

This is the repository for a Master Thesis project on Explainable Artifical Intelligence. The repository contains the code that was used to do the investigation and analysis for the thesis.

The development is done purely in python and the files are all Jupyter Notebooks in the .ipynb format.

The repository contains two main folders: "data" and "final-notebooks". The data folder contains the datasets and the final-notebooks folder contains 13 Jupyter notebooks. Firstly, there is one notebook for SHAP, one for LIME and one for ELI5 and Manifold together for each dataset. Secondly, there is one notebook for each dataset for the new proposed method. And finally, there is one notebook for the manual model stability investigation.

There is also a file named "requirements.txt" in the parent directory. This contains all the packages and dependencies that are required to run the notebooks. Please install the packages in that file before running the notebooks.
